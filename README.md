# 🚄 BG-Rail: Ticketing System Architecture

![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-94%25-blue) ![Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET-8.0-purple)

**A clean-architecture simulation of the Bulgarian railway booking ecosystem.**
This repository serves as the final submission for the **Software Testing & Quality Assurance** module. It demonstrates rigorous adherence to STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle) phases, from Requirements Engineering to Automated Regression Testing.

## 🏗 System Architecture
The solution follows a strict **Interface-Based Dependency Injection** pattern to ensure testability.
* **Core.Models:** Domain entities (Trips, Passengers, Routes).
* **Core.Interfaces:** Contracts for Dependency Inversion (`IScheduleService`, `IPricingService`).
* **Services:** Pure business logic (Pricing rules, Schedule lookups).
* **App:** The Console UI presentation layer.

## ✨ Key Features
| Module | Functionality |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Scheduling** | Real-time lookup of Bulgarian routes (e.g., **Sofia ↔ Plovdiv**) with specific departure slots. |
| **Dynamic Pricing** | Algorithms handling **Peak/Saver** times, **Railcards** (Senior/Family), and **Mileage** rates. |
| **User Profile** | Persistent profile state allowing auto-fill of **Age/Card** details during booking. |
| **Reservation Mgmt** | Full lifecycle support: **Book ➡ Modify (Date/Time) ➡ Cancel** with history tracking. |
